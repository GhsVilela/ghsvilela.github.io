							<h1>Hi, I'm Gustavo Vilela.</h1>
						</header>
						<p>My career began as a developer, but after a while, I was given the opportunity to start as QA in a new company, 
							to learn and work in this new area, since then, I have been working as a QA and have become more focused on automation 
							because I have always enjoyed coding, being a test automator is my passion. I enjoy learning new tools and working with new programming languages. 
							I believe that everyone should know the fundamentals of programming so that they can learn any new language. 
							I'm a quick learner, if the tool that I need to work with has a "Get Started" documentation, I'll be able to learn it quickly, 
							if not, I'll find a way, I never give up.</p>

						<h3><p><strong>Best qualities</strong></p></h3>

						<p>In a remote world where almost everyone works from anywhere, a lot has changed and the way we work now is very different, 
							so I believe that despite being a good QA, I also have the maturity to work remotely by possessing the qualities listed below.</p>

						<li>Proactive</li>
						<li>Self-taught (I like to seek knowledge and learn things on my own, usually I learn very fast)</li>
						<li>I've always had a good relationship with everyone, whether at work or personal life</li>
						<li>Detailed and super attentive</li><br>

						<h3><p><strong>"Worst" qualities</strong></p></h3>

						<p>Because I am very detail-oriented, I end up taking more tasks or taking the most difficult tasks for fear that the other person who takes it will not do a good job, will miss something</p>
						
						<h3><p><strong>Hobbies</strong></p></h3>

						<p>I used to play computer games, but since the pandemic, I've become a very "portable" person who wants to work and travel everywhere, 
							so I became addicted to portable consoles like the Nintendo Switch, being able to bring my games with me everywhere. 
							I also enjoy watching tv shows and going out to drink beer on weekends.</p>
